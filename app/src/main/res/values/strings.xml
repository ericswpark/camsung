    <string name="faq_activity_phone_mute_title">
        Q: Why does my camera still make the shutter sound even when the switch is on?
    </string>
    <string name="faq_activity_phone_mute_description">
        Your phone\'s ringer is probably still on. Switch it to vibrate or mute.

    </string>
    <string name="faq_activity_samsung_update_description">
        Samsung probably patched out the mechanism that camsung uses to mute the camera.
    </string>

    <string name="faq_activity_android_warning_title">
        Q: Android warns me that this is an outdated app. What gives?
    </string>
    <string name="faq_activity_android_warning_description">
        Android only allows you to write to the system settings table if your app targets SDK 22 or
        below. Unfortunately, a side effect of setting the app\'s SDK to 22 is that Android will
        warn the user that the app may be incompatible. This is by design, and you can ignore the
        warning.
