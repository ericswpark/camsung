## Warning

awipe is still in beta. It may not securely write over every single byte on your device. I am not responsible for any sensitive data leaking as a result of using this tool.

## Usage

1. Wipe your device
2. Encrypt your device (if it isn't already encrypted)
3. Install awipe
4. Run awipe
5. Factory reset from the Settings app, or if the Settings app force-closes due to low available storage space, then reboot to recovery and format the data partition.
6. Give your device away or sell it
