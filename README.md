## Usage

Install, open, and click on the switch to enable the mute function. Click on the lock icon to enable
on boot.

## Uninstall

Turn off the switch, then uninstall. If you uninstalled before turning off the switch, re-install
the app, toggle the switch at least once until it is in the off position (so if it shows as off,
then turn on and then turn off. If it shows as on, just turn it off), then uninstall.

## Warning

Please do not use this app for malicious purposes. It's only made for situations where you don't
want to disturb other people (such as in restaurants or in a library).

This app directly modifies system settings. While it should be relatively safe things can still go
wrong. I am not responsible for any problems that may arise from using this app.

This app only works with recent Android versions paired with One UI releases. Future software
updates may block the mechanism that this app uses.
